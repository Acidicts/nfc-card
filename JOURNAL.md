## 10/24/2025 3 PM - Looked at the old onboard tutorial  

Went through the old onboard tutorial to understand parts needed, and most importantly how to change colour of the pcb using different layers. Here is the [website](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card).

## 10/24/2025 4:46 PM - Made Schematic - 0.2 hrs  

I made the schematic although it was very basic due to it being only 4 components .

Components :
- The chip
- Resistor ( 47 Ohms )
- LED ( 2V Red )
- Antenna ( Community thing )

## 10/24/2025 4:48 PM - Made the pcb layout - 0.2 hrs  

Completed the pcb layout.
Positioned the components and ignored a ludicrous amount of drc rules as the antenna doesn't comply to nearly any rules for it.

## 10/24/2025 4:51 PM - Added Decoration to it - 1.5 hrs  

Decided to use the jlcpcb colourful silkscreen as it enables more designs to be used.
Used an orpheus sticker image and the HackClub anime sticker with Japanese writing on it.
Added fine tuning onto different outlines.

## 10/24/2025 5 PM - Costs / BOM - 0.5 hrs  

Assembled costs and BOMs but due to min item order the parts cost is much larger than wanted or expected.
This led to my decision of using this project for tickets.
